Gol Gumbaz
</figcaption>

<p>
Gol Gumbaz is the tomb of king Muhammad Adil Shah, Adil Shah Dynasty.
</p>
<p>
Construction of the tomb, located in Bijapur , Karnataka, India, was started in 1626 and completed in 1656. The name is based on "Gol Gumbadh" derived from "Gola Gummata" meaning "circular dome".
It follows the style of Indo-Islamic architecture.
</p>
<p>
Styled on the Dravidian architecture amalgamating the Islamic influences, the very name Gol Gumbaz stems from ‘Gola Gombadh’ or Gol Gomata’ translating to a circular dome. Made of dark grey basalt stone, its chamber is among the biggest in the world measuring 18,000 sq ft and the whispering gallery allowing people to hear their most hushed tones courtesy the acoustics of the space. It is said that you can hear a word echo for about 12 times across the other end of the dome. The 144 ft high roof with a 156 ft cube on either side beneath has eight arches traversing the two squares interlocking together that work as the base for the dome. There are four octagonal towers placed at each corner comprising a staircase. And each tower has a gallery on the top floor. The podium sits pretty in the centre hall with steps on the two sides.
The precinct of Gol Gumbaz comprises a mosque, garden, tavern and a museum. A cenotaph graces the podium in the middle separating the main grave underneath. The entrance to the mausoleum will greet you with a piece of meteorite which is said to have been fallen during the rule of Sultan and is believed to safeguard the tomb from lightning. 
</p>
<p>
Even a slight whisper by someone standing in its gallery can be heard everywhere else in the gallery, and if somebody claps, the sound of it echoes several times. 
The structure is composed of a cube, 48 m (156 ft) on each side, capped by a roof 44 m (144 ft) in external diameter. Eight intersecting arches created by two rotated squares that create interlocking pendentives support the dome. At each of the four corners of the cube, is a dome-capped octagonal tower seven stories high with a staircase inside. The upper floor of each tower opens on to a round gallery which surrounds the dome. The dome is one of the largest domes constructed before the modern era.

<p>
The Lotus Temple, located in Delhi, India, is a Baháʼí House of Worship that was dedicated in December 1986.
Notable for its flowerlike shape, it has become a prominent attraction in the city. 
<p>
</p>
Like all Baháʼí Houses of Worship, the Lotus Temple is open to all, regardless of religion or any other qualification. 
According to Shoghi Effendi, a Bahá'í temple is a “silent teacher” of the Bahá'í faith.
</p>
<p>
Inspired by the lotus flower, the design for the House of Worship in New Delhi is composed of 27 free-standing marble-clad "petals" arranged in clusters of three to form nine sides.[3] The nine doors of the Lotus Temple open onto a central hall 34.3 meters tall[3] that can seat 1,300 people
 and hold up to 2,500 in all.
 he surface of the House of Worship is made of white marble from Penteli mountain in Greece, the same marble used in the construction of many ancient monuments (including the Parthenon[8]) and other Baháʼí buildings.
Along with its nine surrounding ponds and gardens, the Lotus Temple property comprises 26 acres (105,000 m²; 10.5 ha). 
</p>
<p>
The building is composed of 27 free-standing marble-clad "petals" arranged in clusters of three to form nine sides, with nine doors opening onto a central hall with a height of slightly over 34 meters and a capacity of 2,500 people.
The Lotus Temple has won numerous architectural awards and has been featured in many newspaper and magazine articles.
A 2001 CNN report referred to it as the most visited building in the world.

<p>
The Taj Mahal  'Crown of the Palace', originally the Rauza-i-munawwara is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the southern bank of the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra.
 It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal;
it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. 
</p>
<p>
The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall. 
The Taj Mahal is considered to be the greatest architectural achievement in the whole range of Indo-Islamic architecture. 
</p>
<p>
Its recognised architectonic beauty has a rhythmic combination of solids and voids, concave and convex and light shadow; such as arches and domes further increases the aesthetic aspect.
The colour combination of lush green scape reddish pathway and blue sky over it show cases the monument in ever changing tints and moods. The relief work in marble and inlay with precious and semi precious stones make it a monument apart. </p>
