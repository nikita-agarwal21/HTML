<p>
Gol Gumbaz is the tomb of king Muhammad Adil Shah, Adil Shah Dynasty.
Construction of the tomb, located in Bijapur , Karnataka, India, was started in 1626 and completed in 1656. The name is based on "Gol Gumbadh" derived from "Gola Gummata" meaning "circular dome".
It follows the style of Indo-Islamic architecture.
Even a slight whisper by someone standing in its gallery can be heard everywhere else in the gallery, and if somebody claps, the sound of it echoes several times. 

The structure is composed of a cube, 48 m (156 ft) on each side, capped by a roof 44 m (144 ft) in external diameter. Eight intersecting arches created by two rotated squares that create interlocking pendentives support the dome. At each of the four corners of the cube, is a dome-capped octagonal tower seven stories high with a staircase inside. The upper floor of each tower opens on to a round gallery which surrounds the dome. The dome is one of the largest domes constructed before the modern era.

The Lotus Temple, located in Delhi, India, is a Baháʼí House of Worship that was dedicated in December 1986.
Notable for its flowerlike shape, it has become a prominent attraction in the city. 

Like all Baháʼí Houses of Worship, the Lotus Temple is open to all, regardless of religion or any other qualification. 
According to Shoghi Effendi, a Bahá'í temple is a “silent teacher” of the Bahá'í faith.
The building is composed of 27 free-standing marble-clad "petals" arranged in clusters of three to form nine sides,[3] with nine doors opening onto a central hall with a height of slightly over 34 meters and a capacity of 2,500 people.
The Lotus Temple has won numerous architectural awards and has been featured in many newspaper and magazine articles.[5] A 2001 CNN report referred to it as the most visited building in the world.

The Taj Mahal  'Crown of the Palace', originally the Rauza-i-munawwara is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the southern bank of the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra.
 It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal;
it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. 

The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.
